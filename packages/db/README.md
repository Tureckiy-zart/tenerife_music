# Tenerife.music Database Package

> DDD-aligned PostgreSQL schema with Prisma, supporting Day/Night events, ratings, CMS, radio, ads, moderation, i18n, and geo search.

## Overview

This package contains the Prisma schema, migrations, seed data, and Zod validation schemas for the Tenerife.music platform. The schema is designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clear bounded contexts and supports all core features including:

- üåÖ **Day/Night Event Split** - Events categorized by daytime (concerts/lifestyle) or nighttime (clubs/parties)
- ‚≠ê **Multi-Entity Ratings** - Users can rate events, organizations, artists, and articles
- üìù **CMS with i18n** - Articles with per-locale slugs for SEO (en/es/ru)
- üìª **Radio Streaming** - Radio stations, shows, episodes, and track history
- üì¢ **Ad Placements** - Sponsored content across multiple slots
- üëÆ **Moderation System** - Approval workflows with audit logs

## i18n Strategy

### Supported Locales
- `en` - English (default)
- `es` - Spanish (primary for Tenerife)
- `ru` - Russian (tourist demographic)

### Implementation Approaches

#### 1. JSONB for Simple Fields
Used for: Genre names, Tag names, short descriptions

```json
{
  "en": "Techno",
  "es": "Techno",
  "ru": "–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ"
}
```

**Pros:** Fast queries, simpler schema
**Cons:** No per-locale slugs, harder full-text search

#### 2. Translation Tables for SEO-Critical Content
Used for: Articles (ArticleI18n)

```sql
-- ArticleI18n table
articleId | locale | slug                  | title
----------|--------|----------------------|------------------
abc123    | en     | best-beach-clubs     | Best Beach Clubs
abc123    | es     | mejores-clubes-playa | Mejores Clubes
```

**Pros:** Per-locale slugs for SEO, better full-text search
**Cons:** More joins, complex queries

### Future Considerations
- Event i18n: For now, events use single language title/description. Can add `EventI18n` table later if needed.
- Automatic translation pipelines via DeepL/Google Translate API

## Rating Aggregates Update Strategy

### Approach: Background Worker (Recommended)

**Why not triggers?**
- Postgres triggers work but add latency to user requests
- Harder to test and debug
- Vendor lock-in (Neon may have limited trigger support)

**Worker Implementation:**
1. On Rating create/update/delete, enqueue job: `{type: 'UPDATE_RATING', targetType: 'EVENT', targetId: '...'}`
2. Worker (BullMQ + Redis) processes job:
   ```sql
   UPDATE events
   SET ratingAvg = (SELECT AVG(score) FROM ratings WHERE targetType = 'EVENT' AND targetId = $1),
       ratingCount = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ratings WHERE targetType = 'EVENT' AND targetId = $1)
   WHERE id = $1;
   ```
3. Eventual consistency: ratings update within ~1-5 seconds

**Alternative: Scheduled Job**
- Recalculate all rating aggregates hourly
- Simpler but less real-time

## Query Optimization Tips

### Event Listing (Most Common Query)

**Use case:** User visits site, selects DAY or NIGHT, filters by city

```sql
-- Optimized query (uses composite index)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE city = 'Santa Cruz'
  AND dayNight = 'NIGHT'
  AND startAt >= NOW()
  AND status = 'APPROVED'
  AND visibility = 'PUBLIC'
ORDER BY startAt ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Index:** `(city, dayNight, startAt)` ‚úÖ

### Geo Bounding Box Query

**Use case:** Map view showing events in visible area

```sql
-- Step 1: Filter by geohash prefix (fast)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE geoHash LIKE 'eyh7%'  -- Santa Cruz area
  AND status = 'APPROVED';

-- Step 2: Exact bounding box check (in application layer)
-- Filter results where lat BETWEEN minLat AND maxLat
--                  AND lng BETWEEN minLng AND maxLng
```

**Index:** `(geoHash)` ‚úÖ

### Search by Genres/Tags (M2M)

```sql
-- Find events with genre "Techno" OR "House"
SELECT DISTINCT e.*
FROM events e
JOIN event_genres eg ON e.id = eg.eventId
WHERE eg.genreId IN ('genre1', 'genre2')
  AND e.status = 'APPROVED';
```

**Index:** `(eventId, genreId)` on `event_genres` ‚úÖ

## Geohash Reference

| Precision | Cell Size | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 4 | ~20 km | Island-level |
| 5 | ~2.4 km | City-level (recommended for filters) |
| 6 | ~610 m | Neighborhood |
| 7 | ~76 m | **Event/venue storage (recommended)** |
| 8 | ~19 m | Precise location |

**Tenerife Example:**
- Santa Cruz center: `eyh7e2pg` (precision 8)
- Prefix `eyh7` covers most of Santa Cruz area

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tenerife_music?schema=public"

# Optional: External Services
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
TYPESENSE_API_KEY="xyz..."
TYPESENSE_HOST="localhost:8108"
MAPBOX_TOKEN="pk.ey..."
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL="https://..."
```

## Scripts

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm db:generate

# Create migration
pnpm db:migrate -- --name add_user_preferences

# Deploy migrations (production)
pnpm db:migrate:deploy

# Seed database
pnpm db:seed

# Validate schema
pnpm db:validate

# Format schema
pnpm db:format

# Open Prisma Studio
pnpm db:studio
```

## Testing Seed Data

After running seed:

```sql
-- Count by day/night
SELECT dayNight, COUNT(*) FROM events GROUP BY dayNight;
-- Result: DAY: 10, NIGHT: 20

-- Featured events
SELECT id, title, featured FROM events WHERE featured = true;

-- Events by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM events GROUP BY status;
-- Result: APPROVED: 25, PENDING: 3, DRAFT: 2

-- Check ratings
SELECT targetType, COUNT(*), AVG(score) FROM ratings GROUP BY targetType;

-- Radio now playing
SELECT * FROM radio_now_playing;
```

## Migration Best Practices

1. **Never edit existing migrations** - Always create new ones
2. **Test migrations on staging** before production
3. **Backup before migrating** production
4. **Use transactions** (Prisma does this by default)
5. **Monitor migration time** - Large tables may lock

## Schema Evolution Examples

### Adding a new field to Event

```prisma
model Event {
  // ... existing fields
  streamUrl String? // Add virtual event support
}
```

Then run:
```bash
pnpm db:migrate -- --name add_event_stream_url
```

### Adding a new bounded context

1. Create models in `schema.prisma`
2. Run migration
3. Create repository interface in `packages/domain/src/my-context/`
4. Implement service with business rules
5. Update API controllers to use service

## FAQ

**Q: Why JSONB for i18n instead of translation tables everywhere?**
A: Balance between simplicity and SEO. Articles need per-locale slugs for `/en/articles/slug` vs `/es/articulos/slug`. Genres/tags don't need SEO slugs, so JSONB is faster.

**Q: Why geohash instead of PostGIS?**
A: Simpler setup (no extensions), portable across Postgres providers (Neon, Supabase, RDS). For most use cases, geohash + bounding box queries are sufficient. Can add PostGIS later if needed.

**Q: How to handle timezone for events?**
A: Store `startAt` and `endAt` as UTC in database. Frontend converts to user's timezone. Tenerife is UTC+0 (WET) or UTC+1 (WEST in summer).

**Q: Can I change event status directly via Prisma?**
A: No! Use domain services (`EventsService.approveEvent()`) which enforce business rules and create audit logs. Direct Prisma calls bypass validation.

**Q: What's the difference between soft delete (isDeleted) and status (REJECTED)?**
A: Status is workflow state. Soft delete is permanent removal (e.g., GDPR request). Rejected events can be edited and resubmitted.

## Performance Benchmarks

On local Postgres with seed data (30 events, 10 artists, 6 venues):

- Event listing query: ~2ms
- Event with relations: ~5ms
- Geo bounding box (5 prefixes): ~8ms
- Full-text search (via Typesense): ~15ms (network included)

On Neon (serverless cold start): add ~200-500ms for connection warmup.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Schema complete
2. ‚úÖ Seeds ready
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Implement repository adapters (Prisma ‚Üí interface)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Build NestJS API modules consuming domain services
