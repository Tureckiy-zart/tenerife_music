## Tenerife.Music — Stage_05 Fix Implementation Report

### Summary
- Applied all non-API fixes from Stage_05 audit: security headers, SEO/metadata, JSON-LD, accessibility, 404 page, and reduced-motion support.
- External API integration intentionally excluded per scope.

### Implemented Fixes
- Security headers added via Next headers(): CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
- JSON-LD added for Organization and WebSite using `next/script` in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Canonical/OG consistency maintained; contact page now has dedicated metadata.
- 404 page (`app/not-found.tsx`) added with branded layout and accessible home link.
- Modal accessibility improved (role="dialog", aria-modal, focus trapping, ESC close, return focus): `components/subscription-modal.tsx`, `components/hero.tsx` preview modal.
- Reduced-motion support added in `app/globals.css` to disable animations for users preferring less motion.

### Files Modified
- `next.config.js` — added HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, XFO, XCTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).
- `app/layout.tsx` — added JSON-LD for Organization/WebSite.
- `app/not-found.tsx` — created branded 404 page.
- `app/contact/page.tsx` — added page-level metadata and canonical.
- `components/subscription-modal.tsx` — role/aria/focus trapping/ESC close.
- `components/hero.tsx` — preview modal a11y and focus restore.
- `app/globals.css` — prefers-reduced-motion adjustments.

### Testing Notes
- Build: ensure Next.js builds without header string wrapping errors; CSP header is a single line string.
- Navigation: Mobile menu still behaves correctly with prior a11y improvements.
- Modals: Keyboard-only navigation cycles within modal; ESC closes and returns focus to opener.
- Reduced motion: With OS setting enabled, animations/transition effects are suppressed.
- SEO: Home and contact have proper title/description; Organization/WebSite JSON-LD visible in markup; robots/sitemap pre-existing.

### Recommendations for Next Stage
- Implement real API integration (SSR/ISR + CSR filters) and add JSON-LD for Event/Place once data is live.
- Run automated Lighthouse in CI with thresholds (Perf/SEO/A11y/Best Practices) and address flagged points.
- Consider enabling Next Image Optimizer and consolidating remote images to local/compressed assets.
- Extend security with rate limiting for API routes and bot protection where relevant.
